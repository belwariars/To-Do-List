Introduction :
This Project implements a TO-DO list which is a hybrid of stack and queue operation.
Depending whether the item is of high priority, it will push it to the stack or if it is a low priority task, it will en-queue the task at the back. 
Tasks are removed as they are completed. A help function is included for misspell or any other guide/help.

How to Use  / Commands:

add   -  Adds a new todo item
todo  - Shows all items in the todo list
next  - Shows the next item needed todo
done - You have compleated the next item
find   - Finds if you have that item in your todo list
